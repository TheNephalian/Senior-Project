*REMEMBER, DND rounds down all non-integer values to result in an integer

PROFICIENCY BONUS
	A creature's proficiency bonus (p) is a variable dictated by the creature's Challenge Rating (CR)

		p = 2 if CR <= 1
		p = (CR + 8) / 4 if CR > 1

SAVING THROWS
	A creature's saving throw (save) is a variable dictated by the creature's associated Attribute (STR, DEX, CON, etc.) and is added to the creature's proficiency bonus (p, see above for proficiency bonus)

	For example, a creature's Strength Saving Throw would depend on the creature's CR and Strength score (STR)

		save = ((STR - 10) / 2) + p

	The same formula is true for all other and their saving throws, substituting STR for DEX, CON, etc. to get the DEX saving throw, CON saving throw, etc.

SKILLS
	Each of the 18 skills is associated with an Attribute.
	
	A creature's bonus to that skill is a variable dictated by the Creature's score in the skill's associated attribute and the creature's proficiency bonus (p, see top for proficiency bonus)
