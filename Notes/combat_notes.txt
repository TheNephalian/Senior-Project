Step 1: Roll Initiative
	Determines who goes first (turn order).
		Our 1 monster vs. up to 4 players.

Step 2: Perform an attack
	Substep 1: Make an attack roll
		This rolls a d20 and adds the attacker's attack bonus (this is the attacker's accuracy)
		This is then compared to the defender's AC (how hard they are to hit)
	Substep 2: Compare the result
		If the attack roll is >= to the defender's AC, the attack hits, and damage is dealt
		Otherwise, no damage is dealt (the attack misses)
	Substep 3: Deal damage
		Subtract the attack's damage from the defender's hit points

Sample combat:
Ancient Red Dragon, 500 hp, 55 dmg per turn.

Players:	lvl 10 fighter (55, AC 18)
			lvl 10 rogue (40, AC 20)
			lvl 10 wizard (35, AC 15)
			lvl 10 ranger (50, AC 16)

	In true dnd combat, the dragon actually attacks with different attacks during its turn, each rolling their own attack roll and damage roll.
	^^This way is "true" to dnd combat, but probably more complex coding.
		In reality, the dragon attacks with three attacks dealing 21, 17, and 17 damage seperately if they hit.
