Golden Rule:
	A CR X monster should be a Medium Encounter Difficulty (50% winrate) to a party of four (4) players of level X

	For example:
		A CR 3 monster should win 50% of time against a 4-person party of level 3 players

	So, we need combats to run recursively, until this "sweet spot" is found.
	
	For example:
		User inputs generated a creature with CR 5
		User tests creature for simulated CR
			Combat simulations
				1: 1000x Against a party of level 1
					If creature's winrate <<45%
						Creature's simulated CR = 0

					If creature's winrate ~45-55% -> 49.5% - 55.5%
						Creature's simulated CR = party level = 1

					If creature's winrate >>55%
						raise party level
				2: 1000x Against a party of level 2
					If creature's winrate <<45%
						lower party level

					If creature's winrate ~45-55% -> 49.5% - 55.5%
						Creature's simulated CR = party level = 2

					If creature's winrate >>55%
						raise party level

				...
