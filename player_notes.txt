This text file to describe the player class, and the subsequent 'dnd class' subclasses in regards to our app's combat simulator

The player class will need the following member variables:

	lvl (player level)
	hp (hit points, the player's maximum hp)
	curr_hp (the player's current hp, this will matter for combat)
	ac (Armor class, how hard it is to hit them)
	prof_bns (proficiency bonus, can be determined from player level)
	is_defeated (a value that states whether or not the player is defeated, could be a boolean, normally False or 0)

	str (Strength score)
	dex (Dexterity score)
	con (Constitution score)
	int (Intelligence score)
	wis (Wisdom score)
	cha (Charisma score)

	dex_bns (dexterity bonus)
		any attribute bonus can be determined with: attr_bns = math.floor((attr - 10)/2))
	dmg_per_rnd (damage per round)
	atk_bns (attack bonus, can be determined from various things; we'll talk about this in our meeting FEB23)

The player class will need the following member functions (not sure what kind of arguments will need for each):

	Functions I'm pretty sure we'll need
		attack_roll()
			This function will perform the player's attack attempt.
			It will roll one d20 and add that player's proficiency bonus and their associated attribute bonus
				attribute bonus will be determined by the subclass, as follows:
					artificer -> Intelligence bonus
					barbarian -> Strength bonus
					bard -> Charisma bonus
					cleric -> Wisdom bonus
					druid -> Wisdom bonus
					fighter -> Strength or Dexterity bonus, whichever is higher
					monk -> Dexterity or Wisdom bonus, whichever is higher
					paladin -> Charisma or Strength bonus, whichever is higher
					ranger -> Dexterity bonus
					rogue -> Dexterity bonus
					sorcerer -> Charisma bonus
					warlock -> Charisma bonus
					wizard -> Intelligence bonus

		take_dmg(dmg_taken)
			This function will determine the player's hp after taking damage.
			It will also check whether the player should be defeated;
				If the player's curr_hp is <= 0, then is_defeated should be True or 1, whatever you use.

		roll_init()
			This function rolls the player's Initiative, a number that determines who goes first in combat
			It rolls a single d20 and adds the player's Dexterity bonus. This sum is the result

		lvl_change(int lvls)
			This function will manipulate the player's level (either up or down), i.e. manipulate the player's stats.
			For example, a lvl 1 fighter has 10 hp. With this function, we add 2 lvls to the fighter. The fighter is now lvl 3, and its hp is now 20.
			The numbers we'll use and how exactly we'll mess with them will have to be determined (FEB23 meeting)
	
	Functions I'm not so certain we'll need
		getter/setter functions for each variables

		default constructor

		parameterized constructor

The next 13 class could all be made into subclasses of the player class
Each one represents a different character class a player can be
	They are as follows:
	artificer, barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, wizard

Each class will differ simply in their stats, which will be hard-coded. They'll all have the same functions inherited by the player superclass.
	For now, use whatever numbers you'd like. We just need to be able to tie this to the UI soon and be able to test it.
